# Whiteboarding Independent Project

This repository contains solutions for a whiteboarding exercise focused on functional programming with JavaScript. The problems cover a range of topics including string manipulation, array manipulation, and sorting algorithms.

## Problems

1. **Turning Strings to URLs**: Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.
2. **Array Deduping**: Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array.
3. **Compressing Strings**: Write an algorithm that compresses a string by replacing repeated characters with a number indicating the count and the character.
4. **Checking for Uniqueness**: Write an algorithm that determines whether all the elements in a string are unique.
5. **Array Sorting**: Write an algorithm that sorts an array without using the sort() method.

## Solutions

The solutions for the problems above are all contained in `Whiteboard.md`. The solutions are written in JavaScript. Before each solution, there is a brief description of the problem and the approach I took to solve it.
